Bash

1. Execution Speed || Ease of use

   Bash is definitely focused on ease of use. It's very easy to use and very slow.

2. Existing Programming knowledge || Particular or desired language

   Most people know it somewhat. It's like the Javascript of the systems world.

3. Codebase and Availability of libraries || A greenfield or domain specific language

   CLI tools are widely available. Easy to extend functionality.

4. Low Run-time costs || Ease of debugging

   Ease of debugging is definitely favored.

5. Simplicity of the language || Power/Expression of the language

   It's a simple language, but it is not very expressive.



```bash
#! /bin/bash  
  
# This is the basic bash script  
  
echo " Hello World! "  
```



I like how the language is integrated into the operating system. It's not elegant, but it's extremely powerful. I use it all day and utilize just a small subset of the available commands. Most of the programming I do in my current day job as a DevOps engineer is scripting and automation, and Bash is able to do a lot of basic things that don't require a lot of complexity.



Python

1. Execution Speed || Ease of use

   Ease of use is favored. It's a particularly slow language.

2. Existing Programming knowledge || Particular or desired language

   It's a very widely used language. A lot of people use it in industry.

3. Codebase and Availability of libraries || A greenfield or domain specific language

   Python has a very large number of libraries and packages.

4. Low Run-time costs || Ease of debugging

   It's relatively easy to debug.

5. Simplicity of the language || Power/Expression of the language

   The language favors simplicity over expressiveness.



```python
# This program prints Hello, world!

print('Hello, world!')
```



Python is generally what I use for more complex things at work. I tend to prefer Go, but I often use Python just because a lot more people are familiar with Python. I think Python is a very approachable language. I can't say that I know it particularly well, but I know Python enough to create basic applications and do more advanced scripting and automation.
